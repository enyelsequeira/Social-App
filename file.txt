Creating the PopupWithForm Class

Create PopupWithForm as a child class of Popup. The PopupWithForm class must comply with the following requirements:
It takes a callback of the form submission into the constructor, as well as the popup selector.
It stores a private method named _getInputValues(), which collects data from all the input fields.
It modifies the setEventListeners() parent method. The setEventListeners() method of the PopupWithForm class has to add the click event listener to the close icon while also adding the submit event handler.
It modifies the close() parent method in order to reset the form once the popup is closed.
Create an instance of the PopupWithForm class for each popup.
